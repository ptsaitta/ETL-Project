# Elections Database Project

The census data and election data were seperately extracted from publicly available sources, transformed to have a standardized, common format, and then loaded into a common database for subesequent, facile analysis.

The ETL Project Technical Report.pdf contains a throughout, guided breakdown of the ETL process - where each data set was pulled from, how each was cleaned up, and how they were stored into a common database. Last, the data was loaded into SQL after creating a table schema following the ERD diagram also contained in the technical report.
